Episode 2 : 

npm -> all but not stands for node package manager
we can add our names too...in its repository....

1. npm init

fill the things if needed

test command -> jest

keywords -> anything like, react, amar etc..,

package.json -> configuration for npm

packages == dependencies

the most importnant package in out project --> bundler

bundlers --> webpack, veet, parcel

parcel : 
- npm install -D parcel  {-D to install as dev dependency}
two types of dependecies : 
    dev dependency
    normal dependency

parcel is a super power... 
diff bw ~ and ^ in package manager
^ -> auto update the minor versions
~ -> auto update the major versions


package-lock.json ==> it stores the exact versions of the packages


Transitive dependency ->  our project needs parcel dependency, parcel also needs some other dependency, other dependency needs another dependency......

put the node modules in the .gitignore

package , and package-lock.json need to be in GIT

if we have  package , and package-lock.json we can recreate the node modules....by ->  npm install
